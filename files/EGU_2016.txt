CO2 and CH4 emission rates over the Sacramento in California is estimated using airborne aircraft equipped with greenhouse gas sensors through Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment. To better quantify the emission rate over the entire city, we designed the cylindrical loops for flight patterns over the city and used kriging method to fill the gaps which were not captured by the aircraft measurement. Based on the Gauss’s divergence theorem, the emission rates were measured from 4 flights throughout seasons. Mean emission rates of CO2 (CH4) was 1.5x105 – 6.5 x105 (0 – 70 ) g/s. Significant variability in emission rates was detected among 4 flights and different seasons. For example, on September 24, 2015, the maximum flux of CO2  and Ch4 was 5.7 mmol/m2/s (0.25 g/m2 /s) and 62.5 umol/m2/s (1.0x10-3 g/m2/s) while those of CO2  and Ch4 was 2.3 mmol/m2/s (0.12 g/m2 /s) and 49.8 umol/m2/s (8.6x10-4 g/m2/s) on November 17, 2005, respectively. The CO2 (CH4) concentration and wind shows high spatial variability in the horizontal and vertical domain, so that the fluxes estimations are highly affected by the wind direction. Considering the high spatiotemporal variability of emission rates, the individual measurement taken over the short durations should be used with caution, although the fluxed calculated at the downwind side of the Sacramento shows the persistent pattern and the magnitude. The local emission rates was 2-3 times higher than the entire city-size emission rates, suggesting that the contribution of local source in CO2 and CH4 enhancement can be dominant. Generally, our results demonstrate the new approach for capturing city-size emission rates and its advantages and challenges for estimating the greenhouse gas emissions and its sources.
